# Traffic Analysis and Predictions

## Environment Details

The code was implemented in Jupyter Notebook using Python as the programming language.
Jupyter Notebook was chosen for its capabilities in data visualization and interactive coding.


## Code Description 

This project is designed and implemented to analyze and predict traffic patterns. Three machine learning models were used:

1- Linear Regression
2- Decision Tree Regressor
3- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

These models were then combined into a Weighted Ensemble Model by assigning different weights to each model. The ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy and provided the best results compared to the individual models.
